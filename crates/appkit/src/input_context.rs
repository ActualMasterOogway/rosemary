//! `NSTextInputContext`: the object between a text view and the input method.
//!
//! This host does no composition of its own - text arrives committed, through
//! [`crate::text::commit`] - so a context here has no marked text to discard and
//! no candidate window to place. What it does have is an answer to "is anything
//! taking text input right now", which is what `+currentInputContext` is asked
//! for, and the one keyboard layout [`crate::textinput`] reports.
