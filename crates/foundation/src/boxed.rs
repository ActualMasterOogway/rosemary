//! An object whose body is one boxed Rust value.
//!
//! The shape a class wants when its state is a Rust type rather than a CF one:
//! an `isa`, a `Box` behind it, and a `-dealloc` that frees the box. Registered
//! here rather than per module so that the free is written once - a class that
//! forgets it leaks every instance, and nothing about the object says so.
