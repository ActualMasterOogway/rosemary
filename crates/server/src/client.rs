//! One connection per process, opened on first use and kept: the connection

//! peer), so a process that checked in keeps it for life. A child made by
//! `fork` inherits the parent's descriptor, which still names the parent, so
//! the child opens its own and checks in again as itself.
//!
//! Nothing here is fatal. Without a server a process sees itself and nothing
