//! `kqueue`, on a host that has `poll`.
//!
//! BSD's event queue is the readiness interface every Darwin program with an
//! I/O thread reaches for, and this host has nothing shaped like it. What it
//! has is `poll`, which answers the same question one call at a time - so a
//! kqueue here is a *record of what was registered* and `kevent` is a `poll`
//! over that record, rebuilt on each call.
//!
//! Two things do not fall out of that, and they are what the rest of this
//! module is:
//!
//! - **The queue needs a descriptor of its own.** `kqueue()` returns one, and a
//!   caller is entitled to close it, pass it to `poll`, or hand it to another
//!   thread. It is an `eventfd` here, which gives all three - and it doubles as
//!   the wakeup channel below.
//! - **`EVFILT_USER` is not readiness at all.** It is a flag one thread sets
//!   with `NOTE_TRIGGER` to wake another out of `kevent`, which is how a program
//!   ends its own I/O loop. Nothing in `poll` corresponds; the trigger writes to
//!   the queue's own eventfd, which is in the poll set, so a `kevent` blocked
//!   with no timeout returns at once.
//!
//! Deliberate refusals, following refusal-over-guessing:
//!
//! - **Every filter but `EVFILT_READ`, `EVFILT_WRITE` and `EVFILT_USER`** is
//!   `EINVAL`. `EVFILT_VNODE` and `EVFILT_PROC` watch objects `poll` cannot see
//!   at all, and `EVFILT_TIMER` would be a timer this module drove rather than
//!   the kernel - each is a real piece of work rather than a constant.
//! - **`kevent64` is not here.** Its `struct kevent64_s` is forty-eight bytes
//!   with two more words on the end, so it is a second marshalling rather than
//!   a second name for this one, and nothing has imported it.
//!
//! One gap, written down because it cannot be closed from here: `close` is not
//! this crate's call to see, so a queue's record outlives the descriptor. A new
//! `kqueue()` clears whatever the number held before, which covers the case
//! that matters - the same number issued to a second queue - but a `kevent` on
//! a number that has since become an ordinary file answers about the old queue
//! rather than failing with `EBADF`.
