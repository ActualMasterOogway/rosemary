//! What the loader knows, for the framework crates beneath it.
//!
//! Images are loaded by the runtime crate, which depends on every framework
//! crate and so cannot be called by them directly. `CFBundle` still has to load
//! an executable and find a function in it, and the File Manager has to know
//! that `/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework` exists although no file
//! is there: the frameworks this runtime provides are libraries it *is*, not
//! files it maps. The runtime installs a [`Loader`] at startup to answer both.
