//! `poll`, whose `struct pollfd` matches and whose event bits do not.
//!
//! The structure is `int fd; short events; short revents` on both platforms, so
//! nothing here rewrites it. The bits are the problem, and in the way this
//! project treats as the dangerous one - they collide rather than go missing:
//!
//! | | Darwin | Linux |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `POLLWRNORM` | `POLLOUT` (`0x004`) | `0x100` |
//! | `POLLWRBAND` | `0x100` | `0x200` |
//! | `POLLEXTEND` | `0x200` | - (`POLLWRBAND`) |
//! | `POLLWRITE` | `0x1000` | - (`POLLREMOVE`) |
//!
//! A guest asking for Darwin's `POLLWRBAND` passed straight through asks Linux
//! for `POLLWRNORM`, and one asking for `POLLEXTEND` on a vnode asks for
//! `POLLWRBAND` on a socket. Neither fails; both wait for the wrong thing.
//!
//! The four Darwin-only vnode bits have no Linux meaning at all and are dropped
//! rather than mapped onto a neighbour, so a guest polling a file for
//! `POLLEXTEND` is told nothing happened rather than told the wrong thing did.
